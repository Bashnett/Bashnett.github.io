# Web Application Penetration Testing

Web Application pentesting process consists of the following phases:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather as much information as possible about the target application.
2. **Mapping the Attack Surface:** Identify all potential entry points and attack vectors.
3. **Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to determine their impact.
4. **Post-Exploitation:** Assess the level of access gained and potential for lateral movement.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings, including detailed exploitation steps and remediation recommendations.

Each phase is crucial to uncovering security weaknesses and providing a comprehensive assessment.

## 1. Reconnaissance: Information Gathering Techniques

Effective reconnaissance involves collecting information about the target application’s infrastructure, technologies, and endpoints. Some key techniques include:

- **Passive Reconnaissance:** Utilize search engines, public records, and social media to gather information without directly interacting with the target. Tools like `theHarvester` and `Shodan` can be useful.
- **Active Reconnaissance:** Interact with the target to identify subdomains, directories, and technologies used. Tools such as `Amass`, `Nmap`, and `Wappalyzer` can help map out the application’s architecture.
- **DNS Enumeration:** Use tools like `dnsenum` or `dnsrecon` to find subdomains and domain details.
- **Directory Brute-Forcing:** Identify hidden directories and files using tools like `dirb` or `gobuster`.

> **Pro Tip:** Combining both passive and active reconnaissance techniques yields the most comprehensive results.

## 2. Mapping the Attack Surface

Once reconnaissance is complete, the next step is to map the attack surface:

- **Identify Endpoints:** Enumerate all accessible pages, APIs, and functionalities. Pay attention to parameters, form fields, cookies, and headers that can accept user input.
- **Review Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Examine how users are authenticated and how access controls are enforced.
- **Analyze Application Logic:** Understand the application's workflows, especially where complex user interactions or state transitions occur. This is where logic flaws are likely to exist.

Tools like `Burp Suite` or `OWASP ZAP` are indispensable for mapping and analyzing the attack surface efficiently.

## 3. Exploiting Common Vulnerabilities

A web application pentest typically focuses on discovering and exploiting the following categories of vulnerabilities:

### a. Injection Attacks

Injection flaws, such as SQL Injection and Command Injection, occur when untrusted user inputs are executed as part of a query or command.

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Exploit improperly sanitized inputs in database queries. Tools like `sqlmap` can help automate exploitation.
- **Command Injection:** Manipulate shell commands executed by the application. Manual testing is crucial, as automated tools may not catch all cases.

> **Best Practice:** Always verify automated findings manually and try different payloads to evade defenses like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

### b. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

- **Reflected XSS:** The payload is part of the request and reflected immediately.
- **Stored XSS:** The payload is stored on the server and delivered to users.
- **DOM-Based XSS:** Occurs within the client-side code execution context.

Use tools like `XSS Hunter` to detect and log executed scripts for testing purposes.

### c. Insecure Authentication and Session Management

Weak authentication mechanisms or insecure session management can lead to account compromise. Look for:

- **Brute-force attack possibilities.**
- **Session fixation or session hijacking opportunities.**
- **Unsecured transmission of authentication tokens.**

### d. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CSRF vulnerabilities enable attackers to trick users into executing unwanted actions. Ensure to check for anti-CSRF tokens in forms.

### e. Security Misconfigurations

Inspect server and application configurations for common misconfigurations:

- **Outdated software versions.**
- **Default configurations and credentials.**
- **Unnecessary services or exposed admin panels.**

## 4. Post-Exploitation: Gaining a Foothold

Once a vulnerability is successfully exploited, assess the implications:

- **Access to Sensitive Data:** Can you read or modify sensitive information?
- **Privilege Escalation:** Is it possible to escalate privileges within the application or the host system?
- **Lateral Movement:** Can you move to other areas within the network or pivot to other applications?

Document the findings meticulously, including screenshots, logs, and any potential data leakage.

## 5. Reporting: Crafting a Comprehensive Penetration Test Report

The final phase of a pentest is to prepare a report detailing the findings, exploitation methods, and recommendations for remediation:

- **Executive Summary:** Provide an overview of the assessment's goals, findings, and overall risk.
- **Technical Findings:** Detail each vulnerability, including:
  - Description and severity.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Potential impact on the application.
  - Recommended remediation steps.
- **Supporting Evidence:** Include screenshots, scripts, or payloads used.

A well-structured report helps stakeholders understand the security posture and prioritize remediation efforts.

## 6. Tools of the Trade

Several tools are essential for offensive web application penetration testing:

- **Burp Suite:** A comprehensive web vulnerability scanner and testing tool.
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and service enumeration.
- **nuclei:** Automates Vulnerability detection and information enumeration.
- **Metasploit:** For exploiting known vulnerabilities and conducting post-exploitation tasks.
- **Nikto:** A web server scanner for detecting known vulnerabilities.
